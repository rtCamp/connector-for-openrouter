## Overview

rtCamp’s AI Provider for OpenRouter is a WordPress plugin that registers OpenRouter as an AI provider for the WordPress AI Client. It gives you access to hundreds of AI models for text and image generation through a single, unified API — configurable directly from your WordPress admin.

## Description

**rtCamp’s AI Provider for OpenRouter** bridges the WordPress AI Client with OpenRouter's model marketplace, allowing you to:

* **Access hundreds of AI models** including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and more through a single API key
* **Generate text** using any OpenRouter-supported language model
* **Generate images** using OpenRouter-supported image models
* **Configure default models** for text and image generation from WordPress admin settings
* **Switch models** without changing any code — just update your admin settings

This makes it easy to experiment with and deploy different AI models on your WordPress site without being locked into a single provider.

## Why rtCamp’s AI Provider for OpenRouter?

Managing multiple AI providers in WordPress typically requires separate plugins, multiple API keys, and custom integrations for each model. This leads to:

- **Vendor lock-in** with individual AI providers
- **Integration overhead** when switching or adding new models
- **Duplicate configuration** scattered across multiple plugins
- **Maintenance burden** as each provider's API evolves independently

rtCamp’s AI Provider for OpenRouter solves this by:

- **Unified Access:** One API key, hundreds of models from leading AI providers
- **Standardized Interface:** All models exposed through the WordPress AI Client's consistent API
- **Flexible Configuration:** Switch models from admin settings — no code changes required
- **Separation of Concerns:** Provider logic isolated from your application code

### Key Benefits

- **Model freedom:** Not locked into a single AI vendor — swap models anytime
- **Cost efficiency:** Route requests to the most cost-effective model for each task
- **Future-proof:** New models added to OpenRouter become immediately available
- **Simple setup:** One API key and two settings fields to get started

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Text Generation:** Text generation support via OpenRouter's chat completions endpoint
- **Image Generation:** Image generation via OpenRouter's chat completions image modality
- **Model Discovery:** Settings autocomplete backed by live model discovery.
- **Dual Model Config:** Separate default model settings for text and image generation
- **Smart Exposure:** If both settings point to the same model, it is exposed once with combined capabilities
- **Environment Overrides:** `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` and `RTCAMPS_AI_PROVIDER_FOR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` constants for advanced deployments

### API Integration & External Services

The plugin communicates with OpenRouter's API provided by OpenRouter, Inc. at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`:

| Endpoint | Purpose | When Data is Sent |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /models` | Populate text model autocomplete in settings | Admin views Settings or queries REST models endpoint |
| `GET /models?output_modality=image` | Populate image model autocomplete in settings | Admin views Settings or queries REST image-models endpoint |
| `POST /chat/completions` | Text generation requests | User explicitly initiates text generation via AI Client |
| `POST /chat/completions` + `modalities: ["image"]` | Image generation requests | User explicitly initiates image generation via AI Client |

For more information, please review the [OpenRouter Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms) and [OpenRouter Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

### Limitations

- Only models available through OpenRouter are supported; models exclusive to other providers require separate plugins.
- Image generation depends on OpenRouter's supported image models — availability may vary.
- The plugin exposes only the two models configured in settings (text and image); dynamic per-request model selection is not supported at this time.

- `RTCAMPS_AI_PROVIDER_FOR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — Inject an API key directly when the Connectors registry is not yet initialized

### Developer Filters

The plugin provides filter hooks allowing developers to inspect or modify request payloads before they are dispatched to OpenRouter:

#### Text Generation Parameters Filter

```php
add_filter(
    'rtcamps_ai_provider_for_openrouter_text_generation_params',
    function( array $params ): array {
        // Customize text generation parameters (e.g. temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
        return $params;
    }
);
```

#### Image Generation Parameters Filter

```php
add_filter(
    'rtcamps_ai_provider_for_openrouter_image_generation_params',
    function( array $params ): array {
        // Customize image generation parameters
        return $params;
    }
);
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is OpenRouter?

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a unified API gateway that provides access to hundreds of AI models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and many others through a single, OpenAI-compatible API.

### Do I need separate API keys for each AI model?

No. You only need a single OpenRouter API key. OpenRouter handles routing your requests to the appropriate underlying model provider.

### Does this plugin require the WordPress AI Client plugin?

Yes. The **WordPress AI** plugin (`ai`) must be installed and activated. This plugin registers OpenRouter as a provider within that framework.

### Can I use both text and image generation?

Yes. Configure a text model in the **Default Model** field and an image model in the **Image Generation Model** field in **Settings > OpenRouter Settings**.

### Can I use the same model for both text and image generation?

Yes. If you set both fields to the same model ID, the plugin registers that model once with combined text and image capabilities.

### What happens if I don't configure an API key?

The connector will be registered but inactive. AI Client requests routed to OpenRouter will fail until valid credentials are set in **Settings > Connectors**.

### Which models are selected by default?

The plugin defaults to `openrouter/free` for text generation and `openrouter/auto` for image generation, both of which can be customized in **Settings > OpenRouter Settings**.

### How do I switch to a different AI model?

Update the **Default Model** or **Image Generation Model** fields in **Settings > OpenRouter Settings**. No code changes are required.

### Does this affect front-end performance?

No. All AI provider logic runs server-side and only when AI Client requests are made. There is no front-end JavaScript impact from this plugin.

### Is multisite supported?

The plugin can be network-activated on multisite. Each site's settings are managed independently via their own **Settings > OpenRouter Settings** page.

## Troubleshooting

### No models appearing in the settings dropdowns

- Confirm your WordPress host allows outbound HTTPS requests to `https://openrouter.ai`.
- Ensure the **WordPress AI** plugin (`ai`) is installed and active.
- Check the browser network tab to ensure the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/ai-openrouter/v1/models` returns a 200 status code.
- If OpenRouter's public endpoint was temporarily slow or unavailable, wait a few minutes and reload (results are cached in WordPress transients for 1 hour).

### Text or image generation failing

- Verify your OpenRouter API key is saved in **Settings > Connectors** and has sufficient credit or quota on [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
- Ensure the selected model exists and is available in your OpenRouter account tier.
- Check the browser console and PHP error log for detailed error messages.
- Verify the `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` constant (if set) points to the correct endpoint.

### Settings not saving

- Check file permissions and database write access.
- Look for conflicting plugins that may be overriding the settings page.

### Common Issues

- **Model not found errors:** The selected model may have been deprecated or renamed by OpenRouter — re-select a model from the settings dropdown.
- **Authentication errors:** Double-check the API key in **Settings > Connectors** and ensure it is not expired.
- **Image generation returning no output:** Confirm the selected image model supports image generation via `modalities: ["image"]`.
