OpenRouter connector for the WordPress AI Client.

== Description ==

rtCamp’s AI Provider for OpenRouter registers OpenRouter as an AI provider for the WordPress AI Client. It enables WordPress to access hundreds of AI models for text and image generation (including OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and open-source models) through a single unified API and API key.

**Requirements:**

* **WordPress AI Client**: This plugin requires the [WordPress AI Client](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai/) (`ai`) plugin (or core AI Client features in WordPress 7.0+) to be installed and active.
* **OpenRouter Account & API Key**: An API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is required to connect to models.

**Features:**

* OpenRouter provider registration for the WordPress AI Client.
* Configure different default models for text and image generation.
* Model selection displays live pricing (cost per 1M tokens or per image generation).
* Text generation using OpenRouter's chat completions endpoint, supporting all chat modalities.
* Image generation using OpenRouter's chat completions image modality.
* Autocomplete model selection dynamically populated from OpenRouter's model catalog.

**Developer Filters:**

* `rtcamps_ai_provider_for_openrouter_text_generation_params`: Filter the request parameters before dispatching text generation requests to OpenRouter.
* `rtcamps_ai_provider_for_openrouter_image_generation_params`: Filter the request parameters before dispatching image generation requests to OpenRouter.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to third-party services provided by OpenRouter, Inc. to retrieve available AI model listings and process AI generation requests.

* **Model Catalog Discovery:**
  * **What it is used for:** Fetching available text and image models and their pricing metadata for the settings screen.
  * **What data is sent and when:** An HTTP GET request is sent to OpenRouter (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`) when an administrator visits the OpenRouter Settings page or queries the plugin's REST API endpoints (`/wp-json/ai-openrouter/v1/models` and `/wp-json/ai-openrouter/v1/image-models`). No personal data, site data, or API keys are transmitted during this request. Retrieved models are cached locally in WordPress transients.
* **Content & Image Generation:**
  * **What it is used for:** Generating text completions and images requested through the WordPress AI Client.
  * **What data is sent and when:** Prompts, context text/inputs, and the configured OpenRouter API key (sent in the HTTP Authorization header) are sent via HTTPS POST to OpenRouter (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`) only when a user explicitly initiates an AI generation action.

This service is provided by OpenRouter, Inc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an OpenRouter API key? =

Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to create an account and generate an API key at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys.

= Does this plugin work without the WordPress AI Client? =

No, this plugin requires the WordPress AI Client plugin (`ai` or `wordpress/php-ai-client`) to be installed and activated. It registers OpenRouter as an available provider for the WordPress AI Client.

= Where do I set the OpenRouter API key? =

Once the WordPress AI Client is installed, set your API key in **Settings > Connectors** under the OpenRouter section.

= Where do I choose the text and image models? =

Use **Settings > OpenRouter Settings** to choose default models for text and image generation.

= How much does it cost to generate text and images? =

The cost depends on the models you choose. The settings page displays the cost per 1M tokens for text models and per image for image models.

= Which OpenRouter models are selected by default? =

The plugin defaults to `openrouter/free` for text and `openrouter/auto` for images as there are no free image options available, but you can change this in the settings.
